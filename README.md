# Paperweight

*A deliberately lightweight procedural material generator. Yes, the name is intentional.*

Paperweight is planned as a deterministic, seamless procedural material generator with:

- a portable C++20 core library;
- a native macOS AppKit editor, using Objective-C++ only as platform glue;
- human-readable `.pmat` material definitions;
- mathematically seamless tiling;
- seeded, reproducible output;
- a design that can later compile to WebAssembly and embed in games such as Blastard.

## Status

v0.0.5 is the current Structural Generators release. Layers can now generate
brick and tile grids, seeded Worley and random cells, lines, rectangles, and
circles. Each generator remains deterministic and mathematically periodic, and
works with the existing transforms, warp, masks, composites, and four material
outputs.

The staged work is tracked in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/SolenMusic/Paperweight/issues).

## Architectural boundary

```text
Portable C++20 core
  image buffers, deterministic primitives, periodic noise,
  structural generators, layer transforms, masks and evaluation, generator API,
  .pmat parsing/serialisation
             |
             +-- Native builds and game embedding
             +-- Future WebAssembly build
             |
Native macOS AppKit frontend
  Objective-C++ glue only; no material-generation logic
```

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) and [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md).

## Current scope

The native editor offers all eleven layer operations in its Layer inspector.
Structural dimensions, gaps, staggering, softness, direction, jitter, and seed
offsets regenerate the preview live. Preview work runs away from AppKit's event
thread: rapid edits are coalesced, an obsolete render is cancelled, and a
loading indicator remains visible until the newest result is ready. Scale,
offset, rotation, warp, masks, and the 1x1/3x3 preview remain available for
every structural layer. Included brick wall and cobblestone materials
demonstrate useful starting points.

Format-version-1, version-2, and version-3 `.pmat` files still open with their
historical output intact; saving migrates them to format version 4.

A material graph, physical scale, advanced surface tools, performance work,
and the stable game library follow in the documented roadmap.

## Principles

- Determinism is a feature, not an accident.
- Seamlessness must be mathematical, not repaired after generation.
- The core must remain independent of Apple frameworks and UI concerns.
- Dependencies must earn their weight. Paperweight should not become one.

## Build and test

Paperweight requires CMake 3.24 or newer and a C++20 compiler. On macOS, the
minimum deployment target is macOS 11 Big Sur; both Apple Silicon and Intel are
supported.

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

The native application is produced at:

```text
build/app/macos/Paperweight.app
```

Open it in Finder or run:

```sh
open build/app/macos/Paperweight.app
```

In the app, use File > Open to load a `.pmat` definition, File > Save or Save As
to store one, build a stack in the Layer Stack panel, choose a material output,
and use File > Export PNG to write that 512x512 RGBA8 tile. Select a layer and
use the Layer, Transform, and Mask tabs to shape it. Structural operations show
their own controls in the Layer tab. The stack is shown bottom-to-top, matching
evaluation order.
See [the `.pmat` format reference](docs/pmat-format.md) for the text format.

For a universal Intel and Apple Silicon build:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-universal \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="arm64;x86_64"
cmake --build build-universal
ctest --test-dir build-universal --output-on-failure
```

The project currently uses a tiny in-repository test harness and has no
third-party dependencies. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for repository
conventions.
