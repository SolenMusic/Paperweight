# Paperweight

*A deliberately lightweight procedural material generator. Yes, the name is intentional.*

Paperweight is planned as a deterministic, seamless procedural material generator with:

- a portable C++20 core library;
- a native macOS AppKit editor, using Objective-C++ only as platform glue;
- human-readable `.pmat` material definitions;
- mathematically seamless tiling;
- seeded, reproducible output;
- a design that can later compile to WebAssembly and embed in games such as Blastard.

## Status

v0.0.6 is the current Material Graph release. The friendly layer stack now
compiles into a validated portable graph containing generator, mask, output,
and processing nodes (including composites). The same C++ API can also accept a
direct graph whose colour, height, normal, and roughness outputs follow
independent branches. Existing material files retain their v0.0.5 pixels exactly.

The staged work is tracked in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/SolenMusic/Paperweight/issues).

## Architectural boundary

```text
Portable C++20 core
  image buffers, deterministic primitives, periodic noise,
  structural generators, layer-to-graph compiler, graph validation/evaluation,
  transforms, masks, generator API, .pmat parsing/serialisation
             |
             +-- Native builds and game embedding
             +-- Future WebAssembly build
             |
Native macOS AppKit frontend
  Objective-C++ glue only; no material-generation logic
```

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) and [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md).

## Current scope

The native editor intentionally retains its approachable layer interface. Each
edit compiles the stack into a fresh graph and renders only the requested output
branch; the preview status shows the resulting node count. Structural controls,
transforms, warp, masks, output selection, 1x1/3x3 tiling, open/save, and PNG
export behave as before. Preview work remains cancellable and off AppKit's event
thread, and continuous sliders retain direct mouse tracking. The visible layer
stack now matches bottom-to-top evaluation, and brick layers may opt into equal
horizontal and vertical mortar measured in texture space.

Format-version-1 through version-4 `.pmat` files still open with their
historical output intact; saving migrates them to canonical format version 5.
Version 5 adds the brick mortar-space setting; older bricks remain cell-relative.
v0.0.6 does not invent a redundant graph syntax for the existing layer recipe:
direct graph construction is currently a portable C++ API, while visual graph
authoring and graph-specific persistence remain later editor work.

Physical scale, advanced surface tools, performance work, and the stable game
library follow in the documented roadmap.

## Repository layout

## Principles

- Determinism is a feature, not an accident.
- Seamlessness must be mathematical, not repaired after generation.
- The core must remain independent of Apple frameworks and UI concerns.
- Dependencies must earn their weight. Paperweight should not become one.

## Build and test

Paperweight requires CMake 3.24 or newer and a C++20 compiler. On macOS, the
minimum deployment target is macOS 11 Big Sur; both Apple Silicon and Intel are
supported.

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

The native application is produced at:

```text
build/app/macos/Paperweight.app
```

Open it in Finder or run:

```sh
open build/app/macos/Paperweight.app
```

In the app, use File > Open to load a `.pmat` definition, File > Save or Save As
to store one, build a stack in the Layer Stack panel, choose a material output,
and use File > Export PNG to write that 512x512 RGBA8 tile. Select a layer and
use the Layer, Transform, and Mask tabs to shape it. Structural operations show
their own controls in the Layer tab. The stack is shown bottom-to-top, matching
evaluation order.
See [the `.pmat` format reference](docs/pmat-format.md) for the text format.

For a universal Intel and Apple Silicon build:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-universal \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="arm64;x86_64"
cmake --build build-universal
ctest --test-dir build-universal --output-on-failure
```

The project currently uses a tiny in-repository test harness and has no
third-party dependencies. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for repository
conventions.

`examples/generate_graph.cpp` demonstrates a direct branched graph in which the
four material outputs deliberately select different sources. Layer-oriented
callers can continue using `GenerationRequest` exactly as before; the core
compiles their material once per request.
