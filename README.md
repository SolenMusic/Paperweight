# Paperweight

*A deliberately lightweight procedural material generator. Yes, the name is intentional.*

Paperweight is planned as a deterministic, seamless procedural material generator with:

- a portable C++20 core library;
- a native macOS AppKit editor, using Objective-C++ only as platform glue;
- human-readable `.pmat` material definitions;
- mathematically seamless tiling;
- seeded, reproducible output;
- a design that can later compile to WebAssembly and embed in games such as Blastard.

## Status

v0.0.10 is the current 3D Material Preview release. Its native MetalKit view
combines colour, height, normal, and roughness maps on a plane, sphere, cube, or
cylinder. Authors can orbit and zoom the camera, inspect individual maps, choose
or customise lighting, and move the light manually or automatically. Procedural
evaluation remains in the deterministic portable C++ core; Metal presents the
finished maps and never changes their bytes. The v0.0.9 deterministic
multithreaded CPU generator and benchmark suite remain intact.

The staged work is tracked in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/SolenMusic/Paperweight/issues).

## Current scope

The native editor retains its approachable layer interface. Each
edit compiles the stack into a fresh graph and renders only the requested output
branch; the preview status shows the resulting node count. Structural controls,
transforms, warp, masks, output selection, 1x1/3x3 tiling, open/save, and PNG
export behave as before. Preview work remains cancellable and off AppKit's event
thread, and continuous sliders retain direct mouse tracking. The visible layer
stack matches bottom-to-top evaluation. Compact repeat-size and preview-coverage
controls use metres, while brick layers can switch between relative sizing and
friendly metre fields. In physical brick mode, the editor exposes columns and
rows alongside brick dimensions and calculates the seamless repeat size as
`brick size × count`; authors never need to guess which dimensions divide an
existing repeat. File > New from Showcase loads editable cracked stone,
weathered metal, mossy pebble, knotty wood, marble, and eroded-terrain recipes.
These are the practical forerunners of the planned seedless template library.

Format-version-1 through version-6 `.pmat` files still open with their
historical output intact; saving migrates them to canonical format version 7.
Version 7 adds explicit surface-pattern and surface-filter parameter groups.
The editor does not invent a redundant graph syntax for the existing layer recipe:
direct graph construction is currently a portable C++ API, while visual graph
authoring and graph-specific persistence remain later editor work.

The native 3D material preview is intentionally presentation-only. It uses
MetalKit without introducing Apple APIs into `libpaperweight`; a Mac without a
compatible Metal device retains the complete 2D editor. Optional
Vulkan/MoltenVK research remains separate from ordinary `libpaperweight` builds.

## Principles

- Determinism is a feature, not an accident.
- Seamlessness must be mathematical, not repaired after generation.
- The core must remain independent of Apple frameworks and UI concerns.
- Dependencies must earn their weight. Paperweight should not become one.

## Build and test

Paperweight requires CMake 3.24 or newer and a C++20 compiler. On macOS, the
minimum deployment target is macOS 11 Big Sur; both Apple Silicon and Intel are
supported.

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

The native application is produced at:

```text
build/app/macos/Paperweight.app
```

Open it in Finder or run:

```sh
open build/app/macos/Paperweight.app
```

In the app, use File > Open to load a `.pmat` definition, File > New from
Showcase to start from an advanced editable recipe, File > Save or Save As
to store one, build a stack in the Layer Stack panel, choose a material output,
and use File > Export PNG to write that 512x512 RGBA8 tile. Select a layer and
use the Layer, Transform, and Mask tabs to shape it. Structural operations show
their own controls in the Layer tab. The stack is shown bottom-to-top, matching
evaluation order. Repeat Size is stored with the material; Coverage controls how
many whole physical repeats the preview generates.
See [the `.pmat` format reference](docs/pmat-format.md) for the text format.

Choose 3D under Preview mode to inspect all four material maps together. Select
a plane, sphere, cube, or cylinder; drag the object to orbit and scroll to zoom.
The map switches isolate colour, displacement, normal detail, and roughness.
Height and Normal adjust their display strength without modifying the material
definition or exported maps. Lighting presets, manual phase, and Play Light make
surface response visible from several directions. Loading a material chooses a
bounded starting displacement from its authored normal strength; the Height
control remains a free visual override.

Use Tools > Performance Benchmark (Command-Option-B) to run a visible benchmark
suite at 64, 128, 256, 512, and 1024 pixels. Choose Colour, Height, Normal, or
Roughness before starting. The separate window shows timings, throughput,
speed-up, and byte-identity for each material and size as they finish; it also
supports cancellation and copy/save CSV for comparisons between machines. A
complete run deliberately measures the slow reference path and can take several
minutes.

For a universal Intel and Apple Silicon build:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-universal \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="arm64;x86_64"
cmake --build build-universal
ctest --test-dir build-universal --output-on-failure
```

The project currently uses a tiny in-repository test harness and has no
third-party dependencies. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for repository
conventions.

Set `PAPERWEIGHT_ENABLE_THREADS=OFF` for an explicitly serial core build. The
option defaults off under Emscripten and on for native builds. A request's
`workerCount` may force one or more workers; zero selects the automatic policy.

`examples/generate_graph.cpp` demonstrates a direct branched graph in which the
four material outputs deliberately select different sources. Layer-oriented
callers can continue using `GenerationRequest` exactly as before; the core
compiles their material once per request. Set `physicalCoverage` when a caller
needs more than the material's single default repeat.
